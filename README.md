# BattleshipPlayer
Modified Battleship in Java Console

This game is a modified version of battleship.

It features strictly a human vs computer game.

Instead of both players having their own board, they share one.

The player cannot see the computer's ships, and the computer blindly guesses randomly to hit the player's.

Each player gets 5 ships, all 1 "space" in size.

Everything is displayed in the console, and the board is updated regularly.

It will be shown which coordinates have already been attempted by both the player and computer with a "-", an "x" for a hit ship, and a "@" for the player's ships.

Sound FX are included by Spacco's request.

The game ends whenever one of the players hits all the ships of the other.

You can hit your own ship by mistake, so watch out!

Grid is 0-9.

A strong narrative and outstanding graphics if you imagine it in your head.

As always, run the main file to begin.
